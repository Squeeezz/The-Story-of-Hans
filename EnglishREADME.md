# The Story of Hans:
# BIG UPDATE SOON!! (1.0)
The Story of Hans is a text-based role-playing open-source project set in a fantasy world.
We accompany the hero Hans on his journey through various rooms, where he can make decisions, fight battles, find allies, and even discover treasures.

The project is currently in the planning phase, but we already have a rough idea of how the game will be structured.
# Project structure:

class 1: game.java – this is where the whole game takes place  
class 2: player.java – this is where the player is created with all their attributes  
class 3: rooms.java – this is where all the rooms are created and the events are assigned  
class 4: character.java – this is where all the characters are stored with their attributes, etc.  
class 5: item.java - this is where all items are stored with their attributes, etc.  
class 6: event.java - this is where all events are stored with their attributes, etc.  
class 7: inventory.java - this is where the player's inventory is managed  
class 8: level.java - this is where the level system is managed  
class 9: combat.java - this is where the combat mechanism is managed  
Class 10: decision.java - this is where the player's decisions are stored and evaluated  
Class 11: help.java - this is where the help functions are stored  

# Current status:
The project is in the planning phase and we already have a rough idea of how the game will be structured.
We have already defined the class structure and the attributes of the individual classes.
A few methods have already been implemented, but there is still a lot to do.
